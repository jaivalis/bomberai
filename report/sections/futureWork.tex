There is more future work we could do in order to evaluate different
strategies for AI in Bomberman.

As mentioned in the discussion the game we worked with still differs
from original Bomberman games, we could reduce this difference by
implementing some of the following game features:
\begin{itemize}
\item More types of upgrades
\item Alternative maps
\end{itemize}

There are also more research questions remaining:
\begin{itemize}
\item We could implement and evaluate more kinds of strategies. For example
a mix of the strategies we implemented could work even better
(focus on collecting upgrades until a foe appears, then focus on the foe). Or
collect a certain amount of upgrades of each kind before going after the opponent
could be even better.
\item Try and see what strategies would work the best for more than two
players. One can image free for all play, or team play with any kind of number
of players. It is yet unknown what kind of strategy would suffice in such
situations.
\end{itemize}
